### Assignment comments

For this second assignment I have included 2 functions as request for the exercise:

    makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
    cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

R files code can find at "R files" branch

Both R functions are stored on the repository with comments for review

Thanks for your constructive comments while reviewing my work!
